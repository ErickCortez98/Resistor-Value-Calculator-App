Resistor Value Calculator App available in Google Play Store at https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.resistance1.erickcortez.resistancecalculator&hl=en

## Description
The app supports the calculation of 4 and 5 bands resistors. The layout consists of a grid of colors where columns represent the value and tolerance bands of the resistor and the rows the different colors a band can be in order to facilite the calculation for the user. The user has to select the color of each band in the grid, the image of the resistor will change accordingly and the calculation will be displayed in the top left corner of the screen.

For five band resistors the image of the resistor is not present, however, the calculation can be done with ease as with four-band resistors.
